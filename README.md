## Use Case

The English to French Text Generator serves as an invaluable tool for automatic translation. With applications ranging from language learning to cross-cultural communication, this project bridges language gaps and enables seamless understanding.

## Data Collection

A dataset of over 10,000 bilingual pairs of English sentences and their French translations was meticulously collected. This extensive dataset forms the foundation for training, evaluating, and improving the translation models.

## Getting Started

To dive into the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/english-to-french-generator.git`
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch the Jupyter notebook to explore data processing and model building.
4. Run the Flask web app for an interactive translation experience.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data underwent a rigorous preprocessing pipeline. This included:
- Tokenization of sentences into words.
- Converting words into numerical identifiers (tokens).
- Applying padding to sequences for uniform input shapes.

## Model Building and Evaluation

Multiple Sequence-to-Sequence models were meticulously designed and trained using various architectures. The models were evaluated on unseen data to measure their translation accuracy and generalization performance.

## Interactive Website

An interactive website was built using Flask, enabling users to directly input English sentences and receive their French translations in real-time. This web interface provides a practical and user-friendly experience for translation.
